Exploring systems & stories through projects, writings, and communities.

## Projects

I am currently finding sponsorships and reviewing papers for Python Conference Asia Pacific 2024 (pycon.id), helping my friend for her startup (still secret), joining some game jams, and reviving some communities.

I am available for flexible works. For example, I was asked to create tutorial videos about Terraform, Amazon Web Services / AWS (SQS, Kinesis, Reshift), Python / Java API backend, Extract-Transform-Load / ETL data pipeline, and data visualization / dashboard.

## Communities
